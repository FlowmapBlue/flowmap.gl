# Flowmap.gl

[Flow map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_map) drawing layer for [deck.gl](http://uber.github.io/deck.gl). Can be used for visualizing movement of people (e.g. migration) or objects between geographic locations. The layer is rendered in WebGL and can handle large numbers of flows with a relatively good rendering performance.

Try [Flowmap.blue](https://flowmap.blue/) for an easy way of publishing flow maps (no programming skills required).
